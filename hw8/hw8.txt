Discussed question 1 with Vicky, Daniel and Malika. 

1)
A. Application. We consider only morse code here (not wire telegraphy). Morse code doesnâ€™t address host identification, moving beyond network boundaries, etc.; it is more analogous to encryption, which falls under application.  
B. Application. HTCPCP is built on HTTP, which falls under application. 
C. Physical/Link. Avian carriers deal with host-to-host service within a metropolitan network, is compared to IEEE802.3 (wifi) and other network technologies, and a frame format is given. All of these are characteristic of the link layer. 
D. Transport. Based on TCP, which is transport.
E. Internetworking. Based on IPv4, which is internetworking. 
F. Transport. LTP is a transport protocol that builds on TCP and UDP and provide features that combine the best of both (red areas, green areas, re-transmission, data integrity, etc.)
G. Internetworking. Protocol ensures compatibility of data (intent/meaning) between different link protocols (language). 
H. Application. Protocol governs how processes (whiteboard software) interact.
